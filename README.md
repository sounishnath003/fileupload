# Planning application
 1. Questions
- what i am building?
- for who i'am building?
- what features do i need to have?
1. User resume.
2. Model out data.
3. Think through app UI.  

# Modeling out data
### Name:string
### Content:file_field (rails convention)

# Think through App UI
- The ui must be sweet and simple.
- The app must have login system.
- If we update the app through 'OmniAuth' it will be best fit.
- SPA(single page application) will be the main focus.
